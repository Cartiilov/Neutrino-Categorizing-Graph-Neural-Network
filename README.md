# Neutrino Categorizing Graph Neural Network

This project aims to categorize neutrino particles using a Graph Neural Network (GNN). The data is represented as a graph where nodes represent data points and edges represent relationships between them. The nodes are colored based on their particle class. The graphs are created from raw data, this is our best attempt at making sense of it.
